This is a modified example of, http://github.com/dkubb/datamapper-on-rails it will try to stay up to date with that with modifications to illustrate what needs to be changed to run rails on AWS SimpleDB.

Note: that you can switch your tests to run on SimpleDB by altering your config/database.yml I don't recommend this cause it is slow, and it then costs you money to run your tests. We have run our tests on sqlite, while having our production app on Simple DB for a number of years with out problems.

Another thing to note, is that SimpleDB has eventual consistancy, which means sometimes an object isn't removed or added immediately this can result in some weird behavior on this basic rails example. There are strategies to deal with this, but none of the methods are implemented in this example. 

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or comments.
